        <h2>Alan Mathison Turing (1912-1954)</h2>
        <p>The Father of Modern Computing</p>

        <p>Alan Turing was not just a mathematician, but a visionary whose work laid the foundation for modern computing. He conceptualized the idea of a universal machine that could compute anything that is computable. Today, we refer to this as the Turing machine, which underpins the theoretical basis for the computer on which you're reading this tribute.</p>

        <h2>Notable Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turing Machine (1936)</strong> - A theoretical device that can simulate any algorithm's logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Codebreaking in World War II</strong> - As a key member at Bletchley Park, Turing played a significant role in breaking the Enigma code used by the German military, arguably shortening the war by years and saving countless lives.</li>
            <li><strong>The Turing Test (1950)</strong> - Turing proposed a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. Even today, the Turing Test remains an influential idea in the study of artificial intelligence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Life and Legacy</h2>
        <p>Though Turing's achievements were monumental, his life was not without struggles. He faced prosecution for homosexual acts in 1952, which were then criminalized in the UK. Tragically, this led to his untimely death in 1954. It wasn't until 2013 that Turing received a posthumous royal pardon.</p>

        <p>In 1966, the Turing Award was established, considered the "Nobel Prize of Computing." Every year, it's given to individuals who have made lasting and significant contributions to the field of computer science.</p>

        <footer>
            <p>Today, Turing's legacy is undeniable. Every time we use a computer, smartphone, or any digital device, we benefit from his foundational ideas.</p>
